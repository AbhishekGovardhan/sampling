# Audio Recording and Plotting

This project contains a C++ program to record audio samples from the computer's microphone at a 58 kHz sampling rate for 4.5 seconds and save the recorded sound data to a text file. Additionally, it includes a Python script to plot the recorded sound data as a graph.

## Recording Audio

The `audio_recording.cpp` file contains the C++ code for recording audio samples. To record audio, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `audio_recording.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable to record audio from the microphone.
3. The recorded sound data will be saved to a text file named `recorded_sound.txt`.

## Plotting Recorded Sound

The `plot_sound.py` file contains a Python script to plot the recorded sound data as a graph. To plot the recorded sound:

1. Ensure you have Python and matplotlib installed on your system.
2. Run the `plot_sound.py` script using Python.
3. The script will read the recorded sound data from `recorded_sound.txt`, plot it, and save the plot as an image file named `recorded_sound_plot.png`.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler for compiling the audio recording code.
- Python with matplotlib for plotting the recorded sound data.

## Getting Started
